## Eight Puzzle Solver with Breadth-First Search

### Description
- Eight Puzzle is a square puzzle dividing into eight sub-squares which are shuffled. The ninth square is let-free for the movement of each piece. The idea is to move sub-squares piece by piece to obtain the original content back.
- This project aims to solve Eight Puzzle by using brute-force Breadth-First Search technique.
- The outcome of this project is for self-learning to understand how graph-traversal algorithms could be implemented in the context of gaming.

### Dependencies
- Numpy
